# covid-regression-analysis
Project Date: September 2020 - December 2020
Supervisor: Dr. Adela Lau

This was a self-guided group project linear regression analysis between spread of covid cases and other variables as part of STAT1005: Foundations of Data Science course at the University of Hong Kong. We were in charge of researching our sources, finding and cleaning our own data, then setting up our own regression tests to run. 

I created the code for the data cleaning, analysis and visualisation, which I did using Python, utilising the Numpy and Pandas libraries extensively. For the data visualisation, I opted to use the Seaborn library, since it handled the data in the Pandas dataframe more easily, although I did consider using the similar Matplotlib library. I also helped out with the research and data collection portions of the project. 

In total, we chose 10 variables to analyse: population, population density, median age, mean humidity, mean temperature, mean elevation, workforce participation, percentage of people wearing masks, percentage of people social distancing, and government healthcare expenses.
